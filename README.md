### Getting started

Make sure you have Neon set up and the api is configured to use your database.

To do this, create a `.dev.vars` file with your Neon connection string as the `DATABASE_URL` ,open api key `OPENAI_API_KEY` and Github Personal access tokens (classic) `TOKEN` as key and value (see: `.dev.vars.example`).

When you iterate on the database schema, you'll need to generate a new migration and apply it:

```sh
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```

To kick off the app locally.

```sh
npm run dev
```
